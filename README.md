**Why**
Most applications offer 3 theme modes: Dark, Light and System. I always am on the Dark theme however; which forces my experience accross multiple apps to be in dark mode... while I really would love to have a hybrid of "System" mode in "Dark" mode. 
- With this project, I achieved just that for WhatsApp Web

**Features**
1. Automatically switch theme between day and night time
2. Switch between themes manually

**Planned**
- Support custom start and end time for theme switches
- Support Firefox
- Please use the issues tab for any suggestions and/or feel free to fork and make changes and share ;)
